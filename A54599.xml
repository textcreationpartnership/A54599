         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And now I ſpeak of <hi>Fire,</hi> I might alſo diſcourſe of the ſtrange nature of <hi>Bone-aſhes,</hi> (of which our greater and leſſer <hi>Tests</hi> are made) ſo reſiſtible of that <hi>Element,</hi> that if any one would write of the <hi>Nature of Oſtiologie,</hi> good Arguments might be raiſed for the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our dry <hi>Bones</hi> with their attending <hi>Spirits,</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to the Power of the <hi>General Conflagration;</hi> my Conſiderations herein being founded upon the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who held the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Mans Bodie ſhall be by means of a certain <hi>incorruptible Bone</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>After the formal <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> hath vented his <hi>Philoſophy</hi> about the <hi>Creation,</hi> he uſually proceeds to <hi>Adam,</hi> of whom alſo I might tell you, that he may be eſteemed a <hi>Miner</hi> from the <hi>Text;</hi> where 'tis ſaid, that God placed him in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I might alſo inform ſuch men as think it not <hi>lawful</hi> to meddle with any thing that is not mentioned in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> that for their comfort <hi>Six</hi> of the <hi>Seven Metals</hi> are there often repeated; <hi>viz.

<pb facs="tcp:52444:7"/>is to be underſtood that no <hi>Celestial</hi> or <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> things have equal <hi>reſplendency</hi> to it: And therefore if <hi>Adam</hi> had any notice of it, it might then have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly placed the <hi>firſt</hi> of <hi>Metals;</hi> but ſince it is not, let it ſatisfie them to ſtand in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> place, becauſe it is in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and not <hi>Quicksilver,</hi> and was known to former Ages, though not to us, unleſs what is imitated by <hi>Art:</hi> And as I have given you a hint of ſome obſervations upon two or three <hi>Metals,</hi> I might run through the reſt, but that were to make a <hi>Book</hi> of a <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might alſo adde, that it is thought by <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> in writing the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Creation</hi> did my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically teach the whole progreſs of the <hi>Metallick Art,</hi> and that <hi>Mayerus</hi> teacheth this Art alſo by the uſe of <hi>Muſick:</hi> But theſe and many other <hi>ſpeculations</hi> I wave, for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are rather to inſtruct others in the <hi>practicall Part,</hi> then amuſe them with the <hi>Theory;</hi> therefore that they may be the better guided, give me leave to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the 33. and 34. <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Pliny's Natural History</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> and next <hi>Georgius Agricola,</hi> for the ways of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>Metals, digging</hi> and <hi>ordering</hi> them together, with the deſcription of the <hi>Engines</hi> and <hi>Tools</hi> requiſite for that work.</p>

                  <p>THey are either called <hi>Shafts</hi> or <hi>Adits.</hi> The <hi>Shaft</hi> is that which is digged round or ſquare,<note place="margin">Shaft or Puteus.</note> like a Well, from which the Earth that is digged is wound up in Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets by Ropes, as we do Buckets of water; and theſe are not onely for that uſe, but likewiſe to give air to the Mine. And ofttimes Pumps are put into theſe <hi>Shafts,</hi> to fetch out the water; for theſe <hi>Shafts</hi> are in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces 40, 50, or 60 fathom deep before the Miners come to the <hi>Metal</hi> or <hi>Minerals</hi> for which they dig.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Adit</hi> is from the Latine word <hi>Aditus,</hi> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Adit or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus.</note> an <hi>entry, paſſage,</hi> or <hi>approach</hi> to a thing. And this is uſually made on the ſide of the Hill, but towards the bottom, about 4, 5, or 6 feet high, and 8 feet wide, in the nature of an Arch, ſometimes cut in the rock, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſupported with timber; ſo that the ſole or bottom of this <hi>Adit</hi> may anſwer the bottom of the <hi>Shaft,</hi> but ſomewhat lower, ſo as the water may have a ſufficient Current to paſs away, which is exactly known by the ordinary ways of <hi>Dialing,</hi> or the Workmans keeping the water at his foot while there is any: and he is directed toward the Shaft by a Needle touch'd with a <hi>Loadstone,</hi> the uſing whereof is called <hi>Dialling:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dialling.</note> and by this and other Arts the water is conveyed away with more eaſe and leſs charge then by <hi>Pumps.</hi> And when the Miners by theſe Shafts or Adits do ſtrike or threed a <hi>Vein</hi> of any <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> (for <hi>Metals</hi> under the Earth are diſperſed like <hi>Veins</hi> in our bodies, and therefore called <hi>Veins</hi>) then the <hi>Metal</hi> which is digged from thoſe <hi>Veins</hi> is called <hi>Oar,</hi> as <hi>Silver oar,</hi>

                     <hi>Lead oar,</hi> &amp;c. And by theſe <hi>Adits</hi> the <hi>Fumes, Damps,</hi> and unwholeſome Vapours,<note place="margin">Damps.</note> are better diſperſed, which otherwiſe might endanger the <hi>Miners;</hi> but if any of

As for <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> which are the nobler and richer <hi>Metals</hi> we have not yet diſcovered any Mines which yield perfect <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver oar</hi> (as in <hi>America</hi> and other hotter Climats, although we are not altogether out of hopes of very rich ones in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi>) but our former and later Ages here have and yet do get Gold and Silver meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Extraction,</hi> or melting thoſe baſer hard Metals, ſo as by art of the Refiner the <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> is ſeparated from them.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Oars</hi> which this Kingdom affords are onely <hi>Tin, Copper oar, Lead oar, Iro oar</hi> and <hi>Cadmine oar</hi> (which ſome call <hi>Callamine</hi>) of which <hi>Braſs</hi> is made with a mixture of Copper. And theſe Oars being digged,

                  <p>AS it is queſtionable whether there be any Element pure; ſo it may be doubted, whether there be any <hi>Metal</hi> without a mixture of other <hi>Metals.</hi> For in hot Countries, where <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> are ſo pregnant, that both for bulk and value they give the denomination of a <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver Mine;</hi> yet even from theſe <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Copper,</hi> &amp;c. may be extracted in ſome ſmall proportion: ſo with us, though the bulk be <hi>Tin, Copper, Lead, Iron, Cadmine,</hi> &amp;c. yet even from the worſt of them ſome <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> may alſo be extracted; and moſtly ſo much, as that the value of that little which is extracted, may be much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that of the bulk from whence it had its extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>And with the ſeveral mixtures of theſe ſeveral <hi>Metals</hi> other Forms are produced; as <hi>Tin</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> make <hi>Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Tin</hi> and <hi>Braſs</hi> make <hi>Alchymy, Copper</hi> and <hi>Cadmine</hi> make <hi>Braſs.</hi> And ſometimes <hi>Steel</hi> is found perfect through natural hardneſs, but <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Tin</hi> make it by art. <hi>Tin, Lead, Braſs</hi> and <hi>Copper</hi> make that <hi>tunable metal</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Why our Mines, affording Gold or Silver, ſhould properly belong to the King by His Prerogative.</head>
                  <p>WHere the Supreme Power of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War</hi> is fixed (as with us it is acknowledged in the <hi>King</hi>) he ought to have thoſe Attendances to his Power, which may either continue the one, or ſupport the other. And <hi>Money</hi> (the Product of <hi>Metals</hi>) being the <hi>Ligament</hi> of that, and <hi>Nerve</hi> of this; it is moſt reaſonable, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is more honoured then the <hi>Effect,</hi> that He whoſe very <hi>Image and Superſcription</hi> makes <hi>Metal</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> paſſable, ſhould in Politicks have the command of thoſe <hi>Mines,</hi> to which after ſome progreſs of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> His mere <hi>Image</hi> gives the <hi>Reputation;</hi> for that which we call <hi>Intrinſick Value,</hi> is ſtill but according to <hi>Extriuſick uſe.</hi> For we find in Hiſtory, that <hi>Copper, Ten, Lead,</hi> nay even <hi>Leather,</hi> have been in as great eſteem; and at this day <hi>Iron</hi> in ſome Forein parts is more paſſable then <hi>Gold.</hi> So that having the effects of its virtue from our <hi>Caſars</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, it is juſt that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould have his due, and all the means and aſſiſtances to art in the Effects thtreof. Nor doth it appear by any Record, that this Prerogative was ever oppoſed by any Proprietor: For the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Caſe (hereafter mentioned, and ſet down at large by <hi>Plowden,</hi> concerning the <hi>Copper Mines</hi> at <hi>Keſwick</hi> in that Countie) was onely whether in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Manour</hi> to the <hi>Earl,</hi> together with all Mines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid <hi>Manour,</hi> the Mines alſo ſhould paſs; and it was reſolved by moſt of the Judges, that though the Grant of the <hi>Manour</hi> was good, yet the King could not alienate <hi>Mines,</hi> being perfectly linked to the Prerogative of the Crown: ſo that this Oppoſition was rather to <hi>explain</hi> his Grant, then to oppoſe the Prerogative. For
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52444:22"/>the <hi>Queens</hi> Deputies workt the ſaid Mine without any further oppoſition of the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> or his <hi>Sacceſsors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſoon after She fix'd the Conduct of that Affair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Corporation,</hi> reſerving to Her Self a <hi>proportion</hi> of what they ſhould get, and a <hi>pre-emption</hi> of what was ſaleable, in caſe She had uſe for it; and leſt the benefit of the <hi>Mines</hi> ſhould exceed the bounds of a Subjects Fortune, She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to Her Self and Her Succeſſors a Power at any time to reaſſume the management of thoſe Affairs to Her Self, paying to the <hi>Corporation</hi> ſuch Compenſation as ſhould be indifferently awarded.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXIII</hi> Why the Government of the Mines was by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> committed to the Conduct of Corporations.</head>
                  <p>AS it is conceived, the firſt Reaſon of the <hi>Queens</hi> committing them to <hi>Corporations</hi> was, that the <hi>Crowns</hi> Prerogative therein might be permanent; for our <hi>Laws</hi> ſay that <hi>Corporations</hi> never die.</p>
                  <p>Next, that the <hi>Arts, Methods, Rules</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> by which they were to be conducted, might be regiſtred by them for the uſe of Poſterity, which in former times were but looſe und uncertain, and died with the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers; for no former extant Records do aſſiſt us herein. And this makes other Nations ſo famous, becauſe by way of Corporation they entail their <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Manufactures</hi> to their Succeſſors, thinking them no derogation to any of their other Degrees of Honour, to which they have by thoſe <hi>Arts</hi> or otherwiſe atchieved. And the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo ſtrict herein, that when any <hi>Artificer</hi> died, the Heir of that Artificer was convened before <hi>Judges</hi> about the things of that <hi>Art</hi> which he profeſſed.</p>
                  <p>The third reaſon was, from Her obſervation of the Inartificialneſs of former Ages in this Concern; which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52444:23"/>may be collected from Her ſending for and imploying ſo many <hi>Germans</hi> and others Foreiners, (where <hi>Mines</hi> were plentiful, and the <hi>Arts</hi> belonging to them) who might put us into the tract of managing ours, in <hi>finding</hi> and <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them, and in <hi>ſmelting</hi> and <hi>refining Metals.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Queen</hi> provided in Her <hi>Charter,</hi> that 8 Foreiners might be admitted, and upon ſuch admiſſion of any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiner, he was to have <hi>Letters Patents</hi> for his <hi>Indenization</hi> without Fees or Charge; and not onely they, but all perſons intereſſed in theſe Operations, are to be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all <hi>Fifteenths, Tenths, Subſidies, Taxes, Impoſitions</hi> and <hi>Charges,</hi> except ſuch as are excepted in the Patent, and all <hi>Officers, Miners,</hi> &amp;c. to be free from <hi>Juries</hi> and <hi>Arreſts,</hi> for which the <hi>Civil Law</hi> (which is the ground of moſt of our <hi>Laws</hi> concerning <hi>Arts</hi>) gives this reaſon, becauſe the Charge, Care, Circumſpection and Labour (if duly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted) are ſo great and advantageous to the Publick, that it was thought but reaſonable by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by their example for us, to give them encouragement by ſuch <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that this Nation was ſo unknowing in the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Affair, is evident from the great quantities of <hi>Slags</hi> from <hi>Lead,</hi> and <hi>Cinders</hi> from <hi>Iron,</hi> which by former Ages were thrown aſide as of no uſe, but to mend High ways, or to build with inſtead of Stone. But of theſe our preſent <hi>Artiſts</hi> do make as great if not greater profit, then of freſh Oars; for which though <hi>Philoſophers</hi> give ſome ſpecious reaſons, yet their goodneſs may rather be imputed to the defect of former skill, in not duly <hi>melting</hi> and <hi>refining</hi> them, then from any improvement of their Nature by ſo long lying under the Concoction of Heat.</p>
                  <p>A fourth reaſon was, that <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> might be improved, and in their very Improvement rewarded; Curioſity being not ſo prevalent a ſpur to Knowledge as expectation of Gain. Now of the <hi>Seven Mechanical Arts,</hi> viz. <hi>Agriculture, Clothing, Navigation, Hunting, Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52444:23"/>Medicine</hi> and <hi>Martial Diſcipline;</hi> and of the <hi>Seven Liberal Sciences,</hi> viz. <hi>Grammar, Logick, Rhetorick, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, Geometrie, Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Muſick;</hi> they who deal in the Conduct of <hi>Mines</hi> muſt be well verſed in at leaſt five of the <hi>Seven Arts,</hi> and four of the <hi>Seven Sciences,</hi> And though the firſt <hi>Incorporations</hi> conſiſted but of 60, yet they had power to take in 240; and really whatever at preſent men may think) that number is ſcarce ſufficient (as may hereafter be ſhewn) to carry on ſo great an Affair.</p>
                  <p>For it may be confidently affirmed, that as to all <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> (except <hi>Gold,</hi> of which we have but a ſmall quantitie) and uſeful <hi>Minerals,</hi> no proportion of Ground in <hi>Europe</hi> affords better of all ſorts (and Quantities enough for our own uſes, and to ſupply others with good advantages) then this Iſland of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>I eland;</hi> for though <hi>Scotland</hi> be not under our Conduct, yet it is known that there alſo are good <hi>Mines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the fifth and chief reaſon of thoſe <hi>Incorporations</hi> (as is conceived) was, that they might ſtand as <hi>Mediators</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſtrictneſs of the <hi>Kings Prerogative,</hi> and the <hi>Subjects preſuppoſitions</hi> of an <hi>Equitable propriety.</hi> And this was the great Prudence of that <hi>Queen</hi> and Her Council to erect ſuch <hi>Moderators,</hi> leſt (upon miſtake of the Earl of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Caſe, or other Foundation from the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolution of the three diſſenting <hi>Judges</hi> of the twelve) others might raiſe further Diſputes.</p>

                  <p>AFter the Suit determined between the <hi>Queen</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the <hi>Society</hi> did erect ſeveral <hi>Mills</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> at <hi>Keſwick</hi> in <hi>Cumberl.</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Howceter</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> where they had plenty of good and rich <hi>Copper oar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Copper Works.</note> which afforded great profit to themſelves and the Nation.

And as encouragements it appears by the old Books, that for many years there was very great profit made of them, both Publick and Private: and it may be evidenced that all ſorts of <hi>Copper</hi> and <hi>Braſs</hi> Manufacture might from thence receive both for <hi>Our ſelves</hi> and <hi>Foreiners;</hi> and theſe maintained no leſs then 4000 Artificers and Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers daily.</p>

                  <p>Theſe five great <hi>Works</hi> were wrought for many years with the joint Stock of the firſt <hi>Incorporators,</hi> under the Conduct of themſelves; but afterward Sir <hi>Hugh Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> undertook thoſe in <hi>Cardiganſhire,</hi> paying 400 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Rent to the <hi>Society,</hi> and he cleared Monethly the ſumme of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and had he not diverted his Gains to the making of the <hi>New River</hi> from <hi>Ware</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he would have been Maſter of a Maſs of Wealth; but great Wits and Purſes ſeldom know how to give bounds to their Deſignments, and by undertaking too many things, fail in all. And we may further give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the Beneficialneſs of thoſe Mines, whenas Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Buſhell,</hi> by his Knowledge and Ingenuitie to work
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52444:25"/>them to the beſt advantage, did find buſineſs enough there for a <hi>Mint,</hi> and with the Product thereof made proviſion for the Clothing of the late <hi>Kings whole Army.</hi> Theſe two laſt are particularlie mentioned, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the others may be collected by the Inſtances of theſe.</p>
                  <p>And as for the advantages which the due management of theſe would produce, they are hinted in Chap. V. &amp; VI. But it might be added with a ſubmiſſive Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that with due care herein we might give Law to all <hi>Europe,</hi> as to all <hi>Utenſils</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> whether conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Domeſtick</hi> or <hi>Publick, Civil</hi> or <hi>Martial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Advantages being ſo, we may juſtlie infer, that by the not dulie and carefullie managing of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, the Diſadvantages are in the ſame degrees as much prejudicial to the Intereſt of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as the due uſe of them would be <hi>profitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is clearlie demonſtrable, that everie Year for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Years paſt, this Kingdom hath by negligence herein loſt a <hi>Million of Money,</hi> which by vigilance they might have ſaved: whereby we want when others abound with our <hi>own natural Store.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52444:32"/>of ſuch <hi>Artiſts,</hi> till near 50 years after; for Mr. <hi>Prinn</hi> in his <hi>Aurum Reginae</hi> ſaith, that in the 34th. of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. the <hi>King,</hi> by advice of his <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> did then grant 4 ſucceſſive <hi>Patents</hi> and <hi>Commiſsions</hi> to ſeveral <hi>Knights, Citizens</hi> of <hi>London, Chemiſts Monks</hi> and <hi>Maſs-prieſts</hi> (<hi>non obſtante</hi> the Law of <hi>Henry</hi> IV.) to find out the <hi>Philoſophers stone</hi> or <hi>Elixir,</hi> which would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cure all Diſeaſes, and make Men live to the utmoſt poſſibility of Nature; but likewiſe <hi>tranſubstantiate</hi> other <hi>Metals</hi> into moſt true and ſolid <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> to the great benefit of the Realm, and the enabling the <hi>King</hi> in very few years to pay all the Debts of the <hi>Crown</hi> in real <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver;</hi> and theſe <hi>Commiſsions</hi> and <hi>Patents</hi> (ſaith he in his Marginal Notes) the King granted to <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> upon this very account, that becauſe they were ſo good Artiſts in <hi>Tranſubstantiating Bread and Wine</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> they might as well <hi>tranſubſtantiate baſer Metals into better.</hi> But it ſeems the King (upon better advice) did in the 35th. of his Reign grant new Letters Patents to ten ſeveral Conſiderable Perſons of Eminent Qualities, (therein mentioned) to judge and certifie to Him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing were <hi>practical or no,</hi> and whether it would conduce more to the good or hurt of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> But it ſeems Mr. <hi>Prinn</hi> with his indefatigable Labours could not find any Report upon the Patent, whether or no the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone</hi> was found, or whether the Kings debts were paid thereby; or elſe he reſerved that ſecret to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>However our Laws take little notice of them till the 7th. of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. in <hi>Dier</hi> 88. when one <hi>Eden</hi> confeſſed himſelf guilty of <hi>Multiplication,</hi> viz. that he had practiſed to make the Fifth Eſſence, and the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone,</hi> whereby all Metals may be made Gold and Silver; and alſo that he had accuſed one <hi>Whally</hi> then Priſoner in the Tower, that he did move and procure him to practiſe that Art, and that <hi>Whally</hi> had imployed Monie for <hi>red wine</hi> and other things neceſſary for that <hi>Art;</hi> and becauſe the

                  <p>Now beſides the former Reaſons this may be added as one very probable, why the <hi>Queen</hi> did frame theſe <hi>Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, viz.</hi> that they might ſee and inſpect thoſe <hi>Impoſtures</hi> and <hi>Sophiſtications</hi> ſo deſtructive to Commutative Juſtice, and to repreſent the Reformation thereof to Her Self, or to thoſe which ſhould ſucceed Her, whether done by <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiners</hi> or <hi>Natives.</hi> Nor was there ever more ground for the ſame then in this Age, where the <hi>Arts</hi> of this nature are ſo much practiſed, leſt their Delights (which in themſelves are commendable, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing moſt admirable effects in their ſeveral Operations) ſhould tempt men to make the innocent and unskilful to receive thoſe things for real and natural, which are but adulterated by their <hi>Arts.</hi> And therefore this Hiſtory was writ, that the <hi>Societies</hi> may be known, and the Perſons who at preſent conduct the ſame, and that their aim is not at the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone, Elixir</hi> or <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> (which though ſeveral in name are one in intent) but their chief buſineſs is to take care that the <hi>productions</hi> of our <hi>Mines</hi> and <hi>Metals</hi> may go to their right uſe, that is, for the <hi>publick good.</hi> And therefore to conclude this Firſt Part, whoever ſhall aim at this <hi>Philoſophers ſtone,</hi> according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Writers therein, they muſt be Men of upright and unblemiſht Lives and Converſations, free from <hi>Vice,</hi> and practiſers of all <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> Contemners of the <hi>World,</hi> and onely thereby to ſtudy the publick good of others, and not enriching themſelves, and from ſuch there is no fear of danger, becauſe their Study is onely to do good and not to deceive; nor is there much danger in the other, who under pretence of gaining this Rarity do but delude themſelves and others, becauſe their Impoſtures may ſoon be diſcovered by that Wiſdom and Care which properly belongs to theſe Societies, and humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THere is a Diverſitie between a <hi>Mine</hi> of <hi>Copper,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it ſelf <hi>Gold,</hi> and a <hi>Mine of Gold</hi> containing in it ſelf <hi>Copper;</hi> for when the <hi>Mine</hi> is called a <hi>Mine of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> containing in it ſelf <hi>Gold,</hi> it is intended the <hi>Copper</hi> is the greater, and the <hi>Gold</hi> the leſs; for everie thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained is leſs then the thing containing, and that which comprehendeth a thing is greater then the thing compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; and therefore where the <hi>Copper</hi> is the greater, the <hi>Mine</hi> takes his Name from that, and is called a <hi>Mine of Copper</hi> containing <hi>Gold:</hi> and by the ſame reaſon, if it be called a <hi>Mine of Gold</hi> containing <hi>Copper,</hi> the <hi>Gold</hi> whereof the <hi>Mine</hi> hath its Name is the greater, and the <hi>Copper</hi> the leſs. And this agrees with their Opinions who have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Metallick matters,</hi> and with the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> which prove that the <hi>King</hi> hath the <hi>Mines of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> containing or holding <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> although the <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> be the leſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52444:36"/>But how it ſhall be eſteemed the greater or leſſer is the Diſpute; that is, whether it ſhall be taken according to the <hi>quantity,</hi> or <hi>quality,</hi> or <hi>value</hi> thereof. Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion according to the <hi>quantity,</hi> ſaying, that that thing which comprehendeth an other, is greater then the other thing comprehended; as a Hogſhead of Wine, or a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Beer, for the Hogſhead in quantitie is greater then the Wine, and the Barrel then the Beer, but not in value; and yet it takes his name from the greater, and therefore is called a Hogſhead of Wine. And the <hi>Mine of Copper</hi> containing <hi>Gold</hi> hath its name from the greater in <hi>quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> but not as from the <hi>value,</hi> for in the <hi>Mine of Copper</hi> containing <hi>Gold</hi> the <hi>Gold</hi> may be of the greater <hi>value.</hi> And herein regard ought to be had to the <hi>value</hi> of the <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver;</hi> for if there be but a Quill full of <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> in a great quantitie of <hi>Copper,</hi> there is no reaſon that that ſmall <hi>quantity</hi> ſhould be reſpected; but the <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> ought to be of ſome <hi>value</hi> of it ſelf, over and above the charge, and over and above the <hi>baſe Metal</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in getting thereof; for if the <hi>quantity</hi> of the <hi>value</hi> be not reſpected, then the <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> (how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be) ſhall entitle the <hi>Crown</hi> to all the <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>baſe Metal</hi> in the <hi>Realm.</hi> For the Writers of <hi>Metals</hi> do agree, that there is naturally ſome proportion of <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> in every <hi>Metal;</hi> and the <hi>Smelters</hi> and <hi>Refiners</hi> do make it evident, that there is in <hi>Copper</hi> naturally <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> and in <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> there is naturally <hi>Silver.</hi> And ſo if there ſhould be no regard had to the <hi>quantity</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> which is in the <hi>baſe Metals,</hi> the King ſhould have all the <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>baſe Metals</hi> in the <hi>Realm,</hi> and the Subject having <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>baſe Metals</hi> in his own Lands, they are of no effect: for there is not (according to the ſaid Authors) any ſuch <hi>Mine</hi> either in this Kingdom or elſewhere, which hath not ſome <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it ſeemeth reaſonable to conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>poor Mine,</hi> and the <hi>value</hi> of the <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> in the <hi>baſe Metal;</hi> and that the Product be of ſuch <hi>value,</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52444:37"/>that it countervail the charge of getting it, or otherwiſe there is no reaſon that it ſhould draw the Propertie of the <hi>baſe Metal</hi> to the Crown; but if otherwiſe, then it is to be a <hi>Mine Royal.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. THat <hi>England</hi> is in a capacity to be the Staple of Braſs Manufactury for it ſelf and Forrein parts, by reaſon of the inexhauſtible plenty of the <hi>Callamine ſtone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Parlements have always encouraged Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturies by means of great Impoſitions upon Forein Wares, whereby the Staple may be here for ſupplying Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein parts, eſpecially of Pins; which may alſo be done with <hi>Latten Wier,</hi> and would tend to great ſecurity and advantage, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing the Staple of Pins is now here, and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Latten Wier,</hi> upon Embargo's or Wars beyond Sea, they may for want of Wier loſe their Trade, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To prevent which His late Majeſty cauſed a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of all Forein <hi>Latten Wier,</hi> to continue the <hi>Braſs work</hi> here, which was diverted by reaſon of the late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That His Majeſty's Cuſtoms may not be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but rather increaſed, a Prohibition is not ſo much deſired as a larger Impoſition upon it, proportionable or more to that of the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> upon <hi>Copper,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall be enabled to work as cheap, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Swedes</hi> have ſince entered into a Corporation, with a reſolution for ſome time to be Loſers by their Goods, intentionally to ſubvert the Manufacture in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> endeavouring to inveigle away our chief Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p n="10">10. When theſe Works were laſt revived the Wier was at 8 li. <hi>per</hi> 100. but ſince, the <hi>Swedes</hi> have brought it to 5 li. 5. s. <hi>per</hi> 100. but upon the decreaſe of theſe Works they begin to raiſe the price, and ſo in time we ſhall be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take it at their own rates.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Complaint of the many Towns in <hi>Somerſets</hi> who live upon it, ſhew the great concernment of it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Theſe works being brought to perfection, will cauſe the exportation to be as conſiderable to the Kings revenue, as the Importation now is.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The continuing of theſe Works in <hi>England</hi> will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion plentie of rough Copper to be brought in, and make it the Staple in time, of Copper and braſs, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the means ſo plentifully here.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. It is deſired, that the like encouragement be given him, as the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> gives their ſubjects, &amp;c. We in <hi>England</hi> not being able to work upon equal terms, which by a <hi>Medium</hi> of raiſing the duty here upon the Forein <hi>Latten Wier,</hi> may eaſily be remedied, &amp;c. This Kingdom being ſo fit for it by reaſon of the <hi>Callamint</hi> ſtone, which if we uſe not our ſelves, muſt either lie waſt, or be tranſported: and in theſe works many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand families will be emploied and maintained, and in time may be as fit to be exported by us, as 'tis now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported when and how they pleaſe, beſides the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the great importance, for the defence and ſtrength of this Iſland, &amp;c.</p>

                     <head>An Abstract of <hi>Sir JOHN DAVIES</hi> Report of Mixed Monies.</head>
                     <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for Paiment of Her Armie Royal for the ſuppreſſion of the Rebellion of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> coined in the <hi>Tower of London</hi> a great quantitie of Mixed Monies, with the uſual Stamp and Arms of the Crown, and Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Royal Style, and ſends it over into <hi>Ireland</hi> with Proclamation dated 24 <hi>May,</hi> 43 of Her Reign, where. by She declared the ſaid Mixed Monie immediately after the Proclamation made to be Lawful and Currant Monie of the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and commands that the ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſhall be ſo accepted, reputed, and uſed by all Her Subjects, and others having any Traffick within the ſaid Realm; and if any perſon ſhall refuſe to receive the ſame according to the Denomination and Valuation, <hi>viz.</hi> Shillings for Shillings, &amp;c. they ſhall be puniſhed as Contemners of Her Royal Prerogative and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And to the intent the ſaid Mixed Monies might paſs more freely, it was alſo declared by the ſaid Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that after the 10th. day of <hi>June</hi> next all other former Currant Monies ſhould be decried and annulled, and eſteemed as Bullion and not Currant Monie.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>April</hi> before the Proclamation one <hi>Brett</hi> of <hi>Drogheda</hi> a Merchant having bought certain Wares of one <hi>Gilbert</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> became bound to the ſaid <hi>Gilbert</hi> in 200 <hi>l.</hi> Conditioned for the paiment of 100 <hi>l.</hi> Currant and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Monie of <hi>England</hi> at a certain day to come, and at a certain place in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which day happened to be after the ſaid Proclamation. At the day and place <hi>Brett</hi> tenders the 100 <hi>l.</hi> in the Mixed Monie: Whether this Tender was ſufficient to ſave the Forfeiture, and whether the ſaid <hi>Brett</hi> ſhould be compelled to pay the ſaid 100 <hi>l.</hi> in the other or better Monie, was the Queſtion at the Council Table upon the Petition of <hi>Brett.</hi>

                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:52444:64"/>And becauſe this was a General Caſe, and of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, Sir <hi>George Carye</hi> (being then Lord Deputie) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Chief Judges to conſider of the Caſe, and to return their Leſolution; who upon conſideration reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Tender of the ſaid 100 <hi>l.</hi> in Mixed Monies was good to ſave the Forfeiture, and that <hi>Brett</hi> ſhould not be inforced after to pay any other Monie in diſcharge of the Debt, but according to the rate and value at the time of the Tender. And this their Reſolution was certified to the Lord Deputie, and entered in the Council Book, wherein divers Points were reſolved.</p>
